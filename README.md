Working as a developer in a design company, every day architects design new objects (houses, apartments, office spaces, etc.).

During the design process, routine tasks that need to be automated, arise.

Here is a simple software to automate these routine tasks.

The Shape class will represent the main class of the geometric shape hierarchy.

Geometric shapes will represent rooms (e.g. square, rectangle, circle, triangle, etc.).

Skills acquired:
 - work with Math library;
 - work with Random library;
 - unit testing using JUnit 5;
 - runtime polymorphism(one method name for different shapes in a list of shapes)
